## Indicative marking guide

The list below aims to provide an indication of the kinds of features required for each marking boundary.
Not only must you be able to demonstrate the _final_ implementation of the feature, but your codebase **must** illustrate the evolution of that feature.
The final grade awarded will depend upon the exact combination and features and how well they have been implemented.
If you skip some features in lower bands, but implement others in higher bands, marking will take the overall achievement profile into account.
If you want to be certain of achieving a grade within a particular band, the safest thing to do is to implement all the features in the preceding bands !

**In order to achieve a bare pass mark (40%) you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the following**:
- OBJ geometry file loading
- Wireframe 3D scene rendering
- Export of individual frames and creation of animated video
- Clear incremental evolution of codebase over 3 week assessment period (determined by GitHub analysis)

**For a mark in the 40s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL above features, as well as SOME of the following**:
- OBJ material file loading
- Flat colour 3D scene rasterising
- Surface texture mapping
- Keyboard control of camera orientation (using orientation matrix)

**For a mark in the 50s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL above features, as well as SOME of the following**:
- Hard Shadow (without soft edges)
- Ambient lighting (minimum threshold or universal supplement)
- Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)
- Simple animation (e.g. orbit, lookAt, fly-through, tracking/panning, simple transformation of model elements etc.)

**For a mark in the 60s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL above features, as well as SOME of the following**:
- Gouraud shading
- Rough attempt at soft shadows (using multi-point light sources)
- Reflective materials (e.g. mirrors, metal etc.)
- Specular lighting (must be a clearly visible specular "spot")

**For a mark in the low 70s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL above features, as well as SOME of the following**:
- Phong Shading
- Smooth and elegant soft shadows
- Refractive materials (e.g. glass, water etc.)
- Complex animation (e.g. complex camera movement, rigging and articulation of model elements etc.)

**To get above 75% you must _convincingly_ implement ALL above features, as well as SOME of the following**:
- Normal maps
- Environment maps (used with reflective materials)
- Photon maps and caustics
- VERY creative and sophisticated animation (needs to have the "wow" factor !)
