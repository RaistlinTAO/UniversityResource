# Computational Neuroscience

This is a 3rd year Computer Science unit. We will try to understand how the brain works from a computational point of view.

## Staff
- [Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/) (unit director)
- [Conor Houghton](https://conorhoughton.github.io)

## Weekly schedule
- Lectures (weeks 1-7)
  - 9am Tuesdays (FRY BLDG G.10 LT)
  - 3pm Thursdays (CHEM BLDG LT1)
- Problem classes (starting week 2, 5th Oct)
  - 10am-11am Wednesdays (MVB 1.11)

## Term schedule
- **Weeks 1-7**: Lectures
- **Weeks 2-**: Problem classes.  These will be held in MVB 1.11 with TAs + sometimes the lecturer.  Please bring any questions on problem sheets, past exams etc. to this session!  The idea is to ask TAs questions individually, this isn't a "big" QA session where everyone listens to everyone else's questions!
- **Weeks 8-10**: Coursework time, for those in CS taking the 20-credit coursework version of the unit.  (If you aren't in CS, you're not doing coursework!)
- **Week 11-12**: Consolidation/revision week for students taking the exam.

## Coursework
Please see the [folder](coursework) and the [pdf](coursework/coursework.pdf).  This is only relevant for those in the Coursework part of the unit (see "Exam vs coursework unit" if you're not sure what part of the course you're on).

## Exam vs coursework unit.
If you're not a CS student, you're doing the exam version of the unit.  If you are a CS student, look on your BB course list.  
- If you see: **COMS30063_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience (with Coursework) 2022** then you're doing coursework.  
- If you see **COMS30016_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience 2022** you're on the exam unit.

Please get in touch with your school office (for CS, coms-info@bristol.ac.uk) if you have any questions about this.  Conor and I don't touch the enrollment process!

You additionally may have a **COMS30017_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022**, which is common to everyone.

## QA
The course has two primary routes for QA:
- Synchronous QA in the problem classes in MVB 1.11 on Wednesdays at 10-11am.
- Asynchronous QA on Teams, (as we did during COVID). You should already have been added to the group "Welcome to COMS30017: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022/23 (TB-1, A)". You can download the MS Teams app free [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app), or use their web app (https://teams.microsoft.com/; Chrome seems least buggy...).

## Videos
It seems that we can get access to the lecture videos through BlackBoard.  Unfortunately, it may take a couple of days for videos to appear here.
- Go to the **teaching unit** in BlackBoard (**COMS30017_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022**)
- Go to Re/Play in the menu on the left

## Past exams ##
The 2021 January exams with solutions can be found here:
- [COMS30016](https://github.com/cs-uob/COMS30017/raw/master/exams/COMS30016_exam_Jan2021.pdf)
- [COMSM0039](https://github.com/cs-uob/COMS30017/raw/master/exams/COMSM0039_exam_Jan2021.pdf)

Previous years' exams can be found here (note they were a different format and had a different syllabus, so the above exam is more relevant): <https://github.com/coms30127/exam_papers>
-->

## Exam
The exam
* is closed book
* is in person
* is handwritten (unless you have AEAs, please get in touch with the school office to confirm these coms-info@bristol.ac.uk).
* allows calculators (with the usual restrictions that they be "non-programmable"; please email coms-info@bristol.ac.uk for any queries about calculators)

Past exams:
* [20/21 main](https://github.com/LaurenceA/COMS30017_2022/blob/main/exams/main_2021.pdf)
* [21/22 main](https://github.com/LaurenceA/COMS30017_2022/blob/main/exams/main_2022.pdf)
* [21/22 resit](https://github.com/LaurenceA/COMS30017_2022/blob/main/exams/resit_2022.pdf)

The format is very slightly different to last year:
* There are 12 compulsory short questions.
* In addition, there are 3 long questions.  You pick 2 of the 3 long questions.  The long questions is really just a collection of a few short answer questions, but where there can be some links across the questions.
* Previous years have multiple choice questions and short answer questions, while this year we just have short answer questions (remember that the long questions are really just a collection of shorter questions).  Importantly, the content + difficulty of the MCQs vs short answer questions should be very similar.
