<h2>Unit specific resources</h2>
<p>As a Deakin student we focus closely on what you will look like and what qualities, traits and attributes you will be able to demonstrate as a Deakin graduate. This section has specifically been collated to help you unpack what Unit Learning Outcomes (ULOs), Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Graduate Learning Outcomes (GLOs) mean for you as a student, how they relate to your assessment and how we assure learning at Deakin. Take the time to familiarise yourself with how we assure learning before undertaking the interactive report writing exercise. To conclude, we will introduce you a suite of Deakin resources that are designed to offer you support especially when it come to preparing and undertaking the assessment for this unit.</p>

<h6>Introduction to GLO/ULO mapping how we assure learning</h6>
<p>At Deakin we aim to assure your learning through closely relating your direct learning, e.g. assessments to Unit Learning Outcomes, Course Learning Outcomes and ultimately Graduate Learning Outcomes. This process is known as constructive alignment and in its very essence it seeks to assure your learning at unit, course and graduate levels.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em; margin: 1.25em 0 0.625em 0; color: #006d88; text-align: center;">Students are expected to achieve learning outcomes during their studies including unit, course and graduate outcomes which all contribute to their qualification. Employers are seeking graduates who are able to contribute efficiently and effectively to their workplace from the day they start work.</p>

<p>Though ULOs are specific to your unit (determine what you will have achieved upon successful completion) they are closely mapped to what is expected of you when you complete the entire course and what a Deakin graduate should look like in terms of knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>As you can see this unit has three specific ULOs that you need to achieve in your assessment to demonstrate your learning. ULOs 1 &amp; 3 both focus on gauging your discipline - specific knowledge and ULOs 1 &amp; 3 also incorporate problem-solving and communication. What, however, is meant by self-management in ULO2/GLO6? Continue reading below to find out.</p>
<h6>What does Self-Management entail?</h6>
<div>
<div aria-labelledby="at5" id="ac5" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0">
<p><strong>GLO 6 Self - Management </strong>refers to the key graduate outcome that as a Deakin graduate you are expected to work and learn independently, and take responsibility for your personal actions.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em; margin: 1.25em 0 0.625em 0; color: #006d88; text-align: center;">[GLOs ]describe the knowledge and capabilities graduates have acquired and are able to apply and demonstrate at the completion of their course. They consist of outcomes specific to a particular discipline or profession as well as transferable generic outcomes that all graduates should have acquired irrespective of their discipline area.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; colour: #363635; text-align: center;">- (Deakin University 2014).</p>
<p>It means demonstrating application of knowledge and skills by showing:</p>
<ul>
<li>initiative and judgement in planning, problem solving and decision making in professional practice or in situations that require self-directed learning</li>
<li>responsibility and accountability for your own learning and professional practice (and in collaboration with others) within broad parameters</li>
<li>independent learning, and how you adapt what you know and continue to learn to new problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this unit an integral part of ULO 2 is that you demonstrate your ability to plan, monitor and evaluate your own learning as a data analyst. Of course everyone has differing levels of industry experience, and it is for this reason that we ask: If you already have extensive experience in self-management, demonstrate it. If you have less experience take the opportunity to practice and also demonstrate your ability.</p>
