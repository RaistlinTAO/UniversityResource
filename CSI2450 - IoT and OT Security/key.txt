the range of low value is 1.0-3.7

mosquitto_sub -t port-tide



Next I ll perform a Fake data injection attack to broker from host PC, with the help of MQTT explorer

mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.203.100 -u roger -P password -t port-tide -m "123"

mosquitto_sub -t port-tide -u roger -P password


I have finished the repeat attack test on the server, the result indicate the authentication config is fully functional

However, according the result of wireshark
 User name / Password

attackers initial another 
In order to solve 

T9 advanced
additional setup 
such as TLS certificate (like HTTPS / Http)
ensure the mqtt package is encrypted and cannot be shown to the wireshark
